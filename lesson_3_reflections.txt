When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  All the time! It is critical to have backups of all your work, and a remote repository
  is a great way to store a copy. If there's nothing proprietary about it, public
  access is not a concern. Paying for private access is an option when necessary.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Just like you want typically want to manually control your commits on your local
	machine, updates should only happen when you are comfortable with whatever
	changes you've made. You certainly wouldn't want an automatic update to occur
	in the middle of creating some changes. That should happen only after you've 
	completed the code modification, and thus can say exactly what that change 
	was meant to accomplish.
