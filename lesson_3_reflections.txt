When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  All the time! It is critical to have backups of all your work, and a remote repository
  is a great way to store a copy. If there's nothing proprietary about it, public
  access is not a concern. Paying for private access is an option when necessary.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Just like you want typically want to manually control your commits on your local
	machine, updates should only happen when you are comfortable with whatever
	changes you've made. You certainly wouldn't want an automatic update to occur
	in the middle of creating some changes. That should happen only after you've 
	completed the code modification, and thus can say exactly what that change 
	was meant to accomplish.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of other people's repositories on GitHub. This allows you to
	work with files that you do not have permission to change in someone else's
	repository. Clones are copies of your own repositories, either another on your
	own machine or between your machine and GitHub. Branches are offshoots of 
	other commits to experiment with features or code.
