What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a directory for that project containing all the related files, 
	so that when changes are made all those files are tied together. This keeps the
	relationships intact when backtracking and troubleshooting.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area holds just the files you are currently working on, the working
	directory holds all the files, and the repository holds the commit history.
	
	With the staging area, I can work on just the files that are going to be
	affected by modifications. No need to load files that will not be modified.
